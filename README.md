# seed-ddd-golang-fiber
Seed to start a golang server with:
- fiber
- logrus
- prometheus fiber middleware (thanks to https://github.com/ansrivas/fiberprometheus)
- DDD architecture

# Attention
In this DDD seed I asume that there are two bounded contexts: users and products.
In a microservice architecture, each bounded context should be a microservice.


## How to run
```make build-and-run```
